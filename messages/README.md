I have hopefully correctly implemented all aspects. However, I am a little bit worried that my code is not short enough and the implementation might be a bit rusty.
I have collaborated with noone for this lab, except for asking questions on Piaza.
I have regrettably spent approximatedly 4 hours for this lab.
